      <h1>Hello — I'm <strong>Sahad Ali</strong></h1>
      <p class="lead">
        My name is <strong>Sahad Ali</strong> and I’m a second-year student at the <strong>University of Salford</strong>, pursuing a 
        <strong>BSc in Business Management with Innovation and Technology</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m a curious, data-driven problem solver passionate about uncovering insights that drive business growth and transformation. 
        My goal is to become a <strong>Business Intelligence Analyst</strong> — using data and strategy to help organisations make smarter, evidence-based decisions.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve built a foundation in <strong>data analysis, business intelligence, and digital strategy</strong> through my coursework and real-world experience. 
        From delivering fast-paced customer service at <strong>Aldi</strong> to supporting transport analytics with <strong>Tracsis Traffic Data</strong>, 
        I’ve developed a strong work ethic, attention to detail, and a passion for translating data into meaningful action.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond academics, I’m a global learner who thrives in collaborative, cross-cultural environments. 
        My leadership roles and extracurricular achievements have helped me grow into a confident communicator who can adapt, lead, and deliver results.
      </p>
