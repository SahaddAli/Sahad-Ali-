      <h1>Business & Project Showcase</h1>
      <p>This page highlights three projects that showcase my analytical, technical, and problem-solving skills. Each project demonstrates how I apply data, strategy, and digital innovation to address business challenges.</p>

      <!-- Project 1 -->
      <article class="project">
        <h2>1. Influencer Marketing Data Analysis</h2>
        <p><strong>Type:</strong> Academic Project (Data Analysis for Business Module)</p>
        <p><strong>Role:</strong> Data Analyst</p>
        <p><strong>Problem:</strong> A consumer electronics brand needed a cost-effective influencer strategy that balanced reach and engagement.</p>
        <p><strong>Approach & Outcome:</strong> I analysed the top 100 UK YouTubers using Excel to uncover audience trends and engagement ratios. The final outcome was a data-driven marketing strategy recommending a mix of high-reach and mid-tier influencers with strong engagement, improving campaign ROI. This project strengthened my ability to use data for strategic business decisions.</p>

      <!-- Project 2 -->
      <article class="project">
        <h2>2. Student Well-being and Comfort Food Analysis</h2>
        <p><strong>Type:</strong> Academic Project (Business Intelligence in Practice Module)</p>
        <p><strong>Role:</strong> Data Analyst & Team Collaborator</p>
        <p><strong>Problem:</strong> The project explored how comfort food consumption affects student stress levels and academic performance.</p>
        <p><strong>Approach & Outcome:</strong> Using Python in Google Colab, I cleaned and analysed survey data to find relationships between eating habits, stress, and GPA. The analysis revealed that students who maintained balanced diets and practiced mindfulness performed better academically. The findings were presented using charts and dashboards, demonstrating how data can inform well-being strategies in educational settings.</p>

      <!-- Project 3 -->
      <article class="project">
        <h2>3. Restaurant Digital Transformation - Web Prototype (Problem-Solving Page)</h2>
        <p><strong>Type:</strong> Practical Web Development Project (Problem-Solving Page)</p>
        <p><strong>Role:</strong> CTO & Web Developer</p>
        <p><strong>Problem:</strong> A small restaurant required a digital solution to modernise communication, improve customer engagement, and streamline booking processes.</p>
        <p><strong>Approach & Outcome:</strong> I designed and developed a responsive website prototype called “Delight Dine”. The page integrates contact details, social media links, and an interactive booking form that automatically generates an email message from user inputs (no database required). The design focuses on accessibility, functionality, and simplicity, showing how digital tools can enhance small business operations.</p>

      <!-- Design Rationale -->
      <section class="design-rationale">
        <h2>Design Rationale for the Problem-Solving Page</h2>
        <p><strong>Objective:</strong> To create a user-friendly, professional web page that demonstrates how a restaurant can digitally transform its customer engagement and communication strategy using basic web technologies.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Mobile-first & responsive:</strong> Structured with a flexible grid so that customers can easily book or contact the restaurant from any device.</li>
          <li><strong>Functional integration:</strong> Includes working social media links and a mailto-based form that automatically generates an email for booking or feedback.</li>
          <li><strong>Minimalist UI:</strong> The interface uses a clean design, large buttons, and clear navigation to improve user experience.</li>
          <li><strong>Accessibility & reliability:</strong> Ensures high readability, lightweight performance, and full compliance with HTML and CSS standards.</li>
        </ul>
