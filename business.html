      <h1>Business & Project Showcase</h1>
      <p>Three projects selected to highlight technical and business skills. Each entry outlines my role, the problem, and the outcome.</p>

      <article class="project">
        <h2>1. Influencer Marketing Data Analysis</h2>
        <p><strong>Role:</strong> Data Analyst (Academic project)</p>
        <p><strong>Problem:</strong> A consumer electronics brand needed a cost-effective influencer strategy that balanced reach and engagement.</p>
        <p><strong>Approach & Outcome:</strong> I analysed the top 100 UK YouTubers using Excel (pivot tables, views-to-subscriber ratios) and proposed a tiered influencer mix prioritising mid-tier creators with high engagement for better ROI. The approach emphasised measurable KPIs and clear selection criteria.</p>

        <h2>2. OPAL Charity — Digital Transformation Proposal</h2>
        <p><strong>Role:</strong> Business Analyst</p>
        <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Paper-based systems caused communication bottlenecks and inefficient record keeping for a social care charity.</p>
        <p><strong>Approach & Outcome:</strong> I conducted stakeholder analysis and produced system models (Rich Picture, DFD, Use Case Diagram) in Lucidchart to visualise data flows and user interactions. The recommended platform design improved data quality, reduced paperwork, and provided a roadmap for phased adoption.</p>

        <h2>3. Restaurant Digital Transformation — Web Prototype (Problem-Solving Page)</h2>
        <p><strong>Role:</strong> CTO (case-study role) & Web Developer</p>
        <p><strong>Problem:</strong> A local restaurant required modern online presence to improve bookings, customer engagement and communication.</p>
        <p><strong>Approach & Outcome:</strong> I designed an accessible, responsive web page that centralises contact, social integration, and a booking/feedback form which generates prefilled emails for staff. The prototype demonstrates how lightweight web tools can modernise operations without expensive backend systems.</p>

      <!-- Design rationale for Problem-Solving Page (required by brief) -->
      <section class="design-rationale">
        <h2>Design Rationale for the Problem-Solving Page</h2>
        <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Improve customer engagement, modernise communication, and streamline bookings while keeping implementation low-cost and reliable.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Mobile-first & responsive:</strong> Many restaurant users browse on mobile; the design uses a simple vertical flow so booking and contact actions are one-tap accessible.</li>
          <li><strong>Clear CTAs & progressive disclosure:</strong> Contact and social links are prominent; the booking form is concise to maximise completion rates.</li>
          <li><strong>No backend requirement:</strong> The mailto-based form guarantees that staff receive booking requests without needing a DB or hosting (fits small-business constraints).</li>
          <li><strong>Trust & accessibility:</strong> Contact details are fully visible (email, phone, address) and links open in a new tab with `rel="noopener"` to maintain security.</li>
          <li><strong>Performance & validation:</strong> Lightweight assets and vanilla JavaScript keep load times low and simplify W3C validation.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Generative AI Usage Statement</h2>
        <p>I used ChatGPT to help draft and structure the website code and documentation. All AI-generated code and text were reviewed, adapted and commented by me (Sahad Ali) to ensure understanding and to meet the assessment's learning outcomes. The repository includes a README that declares this usage. Any external code snippets used were verified and referenced in the project documentation.</p>
