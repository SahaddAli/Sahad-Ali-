      <h1>Business & Project Showcase</h1>
      <p>This page presents three academic projects that demonstrate my analytical, technical, and business problem-solving skills. Each project outlines my role, the problem addressed, and the outcome achieved.</p>

      <!-- Project 1 -->
      <article class="project">
        <h2>1. Influencer Marketing Data Analysis</h2>
        <p><strong>Type:</strong> Academic Project (Data Analysis for Business Module)</p>
        <p><strong>Role:</strong> Data Analyst</p>
        <p><strong>Problem:</strong> A consumer electronics brand needed a cost-effective influencer strategy that balanced reach and engagement.</p>
        <p><strong>Approach & Outcome:</strong> I analysed the top 100 UK YouTubers using Excel (pivot tables, engagement ratios) to identify trends and proposed a tiered influencer marketing strategy. This balanced high-reach influencers with mid-tier creators who had higher engagement rates, improving campaign ROI. The project demonstrated how data analysis can inform business strategy.</p>

      <!-- Project 2 -->
      <article class="project">
        <h2>2. OPAL Charity - Digital Transformation Proposal</h2>
        <p><strong>Type:</strong> Academic Project (Business Information Systems Module)</p>
        <p><strong>Role:</strong> Business Analyst</p>
        <p><strong>Problem:</strong> OPAL, a UK-based social care charity, faced inefficiencies caused by paper-based processes and communication challenges.</p>
        <p><strong>Approach & Outcome:</strong> I conducted stakeholder analysis and created system models (Rich Picture, Data Flow Diagram, and Use Case Diagram) using Lucidchart to visualise OPAL’s operations. The proposed digital platform improved service delivery, reduced data duplication, and enhanced coordination among staff and carers. This project deepened my understanding of digital transformation and user-centred system design.</p>

      <!-- Project 3 -->
      <article class="project">
        <h2>3. Student Well-being and Comfort Food Analysis</h2>
        <p><strong>Type:</strong> Academic Project (Business Intelligence in Practice Module)</p>
        <p><strong>Role:</strong> Data Analyst & Team Collaborator</p>
        <p><strong>Problem:</strong> The project aimed to analyse the relationship between comfort food consumption, student stress levels, and academic performance to better understand student well-being.</p>
        <p><strong>Approach & Outcome:</strong> I used Python in Google Colab to clean, analyse, and visualise survey data collected from students. Through correlation analysis and visual storytelling, we identified that balanced diets and mindfulness activities improved academic performance, while heavy reliance on fast food and caffeine during stress correlated negatively with grades. The findings were presented with actionable recommendations for improving student health and learning outcomes.</p>

      <!-- Design Rationale -->
      <section class="design-rationale">
        <h2>Design Rationale for the Problem-Solving Page</h2>
        <p><strong>Objective:</strong> The Problem-Solving Page was designed to demonstrate technical proficiency in web development and to simulate how small businesses can enhance customer engagement and communication through digital tools.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Mobile-first & responsive:</strong> Ensures accessibility and easy navigation across devices.</li>
          <li><strong>Clear CTAs & usability:</strong> Provides straightforward options for users to interact with the business (booking, feedback).</li>
          <li><strong>Low-cost digital solution:</strong> The mailto-based form is simple, functional, and effective for small business needs without requiring a backend database.</li>
          <li><strong>Professional consistency:</strong> Maintains uniform styling, tone, and branding across the portfolio site for a cohesive presentation.</li>
        </ul>
